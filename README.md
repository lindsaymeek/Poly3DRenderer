# Poly3DRenderer
3D cube renderer from Ancient Times (Amiga Project)

Appears to be my 3d solid polygon renderer with surface shading, using a bunch of graphics gems algorithms coded in 68000.
Definitely one from Ancient times, thought it would be better on the internet than on my old hard drive waiting be erased.
